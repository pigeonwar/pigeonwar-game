## In Pigeon WAR
take care of your own pigeon as they fight increasingly stronger foes, and then face the legendary Pigeon God at the end... can you keep death far from your bird?

Inspired by games such as La Brute, Tamagochi and a little bit of PokÃ©mon, Pigeon WAR is play-to-earn game.
I admit that we strayed a bit from the theme, but since we had tons of fun developing this game, we're quite happy with the result :)


## Gameplay and controls:
The mouse is used for everything. The pigeons fight by themselves, but you can choose the attribute points and which enemies your pigeon will fight.




## TODO
All character models are still missing and more variation etc will be coming in later on.
Next step will be the "hub/base" area getting more focus with some intro animations etc. As well a missions and a level system.
We has been working on tons of assets that are starting to come in while I (Dave) have been working on the gameplay features such as skill, AI, shop etc.

It is really starting to come together and is currently running with controller as well.
Hope you like it ðŸ™‚
